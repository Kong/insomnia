Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Using the issue tracker

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/issues) is the preferred channel 
for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) 
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

Please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (email
  [support@insomnia.rest](mailto:support@insomnia.rest)).

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Demonstrate the problem** &mdash; provide clear steps that can be reproduced.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experienced the 
problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help 
to fix any potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might
not get accepted into the project.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
