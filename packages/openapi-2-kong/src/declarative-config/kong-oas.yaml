x-kong-name: awesome_learnservice
# the above directive gives the entire spec file its name. This will be used for naming
# the service and upstream objects in Kong. If not given it will use the 'info.title'
# field above to name them. Names are converted into valid identifiers. For example,
# "Learn Services" becomes "Learn_Services".
# Feature request: honor this directive on paths and operation objects as well, currently only global

x-kong-plugin-correlation-id:
  config:
    generator: uuid#counter
# this plugin is configured on a global level. As such it will be configured
# on the Kong Service entity, and hence apply on all paths and operations in this spec.
# It can be specified again on paths and operations to override the config for that
# specific subset of the spec, in that case it will be added to the generated Kong Route entity.

x-kong-plugin-request-validator:
  config:
    #body_schema: {}
    #parameter_schema: {}
    verbose_response: true
# here we're using the request validator plugin, without specifying the
# "config.body_schema" and "config.parameter_schema" properties.
# This will tell the parser to automatically generate
# their validation configuration based on Operation objects.
# NOTE: this is specified on top level, causing ALL Operations to get
# validation, since this is inherited to the Operation objects.
# alternatively it can be specified on the Path or Operation levels as well
# to only apply to that subset of the spec.

# FAQ: why aren't the tags generated into the Kong configuration?
# The OAS tags are very strongly oriented towards documentation, whereas the Kong tags
# are use for segmentation of configuration. They serve completely different and incompatible
# purposes.

  # the defaults for the Kong routes generated from 'paths' below

  # to only apply to that subset of the spec.


paths:
  "/tracks":
    # FAQ: why does the generated configuration have a trailing "$"?
    # The OAS spec defines exact paths, where the Kong configuration defines path prefixes.
    # Hence the generated configuration is actually a regex, with an end marker to ensure Kong
    # will also do an exact match. Otherwise for example a path "/tracks/whatever" would also
    # match this path.
