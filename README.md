## Developing

Development on Insomnia can be done on Mac, Windows, or Linux as long as you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). See the `.nvmrc` file located in the project for the correct Node version.

<details>
<summary>Initial Dev Setup</summary>

This repository is structured as a monorepo and contains many Node.JS packages. Each package has its own set of commands, but the most common commands are available from the root [`package.json`](package.json) and can be accessed using the `npm run ...` command. Here are the only three commands you should need to start developing on the app.

```shell
# Install and Link Dependencies
npm run bootstrap

# Run Tests
npm test

# Start App with Live Reload
npm run app-start
```

### Linux

If you are on Linux, you may need to install the following supporting packages:

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu/Debian</summary>

```shell
# Update library
sudo apt-get update

# Install font configuration library & support
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig-dev
sudo apt-get install font-manager

# Build capability for required font-scanner package
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>

```shell
# Enable FontManager Copr (https://github.com/FontManager/font-manager#fedora-copr)
sudo dnf copr enable jerrycasiano/FontManager

# Install font configuration library & support
sudo dnf install font-manager
sudo dnf install fontconfig-devel

# Build capability for required font-scanner package
sudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel

# Install libcurl for node-libcurl
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel
```

</details>

Also on Linux, if Electron is failing during the bootstrap process, run the following

```shell
# Clear Electron install conflicts
rm -rf ~/.cache/electron
```

### Windows
