## Developing

Development on Insomnia can be done on Mac, Windows, or Linux as long as you have
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). See the `.nvmrc` file located in the project for the correct Node version.

<details>
<summary>Initial Dev Setup</summary>

This repository is structured as a monorepo and contains many Node.JS packages. Each package has
its own set of commands, but the most common commands are available from the
root [`package.json`](package.json) and can be accessed using the `npm run ...` command. Here
are the only three commands you should need to start developing on the app.

```bash
# Install and Link Dependencies
npm run bootstrap

# Run Tests
npm test

# Start App with Live Reload
npm run app-start
```

If you are on Linux, you may need to install the following supporting packages 

```bash
# Update library
sudo apt-get update

# Install font configuration library & support
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig-dev
sudo apt-get install font-manager

# Build capability for required font-scanner package
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Also on Linux, if Electron is failing during the bootstrap process, run the following
```bash
# Clear Electron install conflicts
rm -rf ~/.cache/electron
```

If you are on Windows and have problems, you may need to install:
* [Windows Build Tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
* [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/), and add it to your `PATH` (it should be `C:\Program Files\NASM`)
