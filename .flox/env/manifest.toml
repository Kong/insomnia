# Set environment variables in the `[vars]` section. These variables may not
# reference one another, and are added to the environment without first
# expanding them. They are available for use in the `[profile]` and `[hook]`
# scripts.
[vars]
# message = "Howdy"

# The `hook.on-activate` script is run by the *bash* shell immediately upon
# activating an environment, and will not be invoked if Flox detects that the
# environment has previously been activated. Variables set by the script will
# be inherited by `[profile]` scripts defined below. Note that any stdout
# generated by the script will be redirected to stderr.

#   # Perform initialization steps, e.g. create a python venv
#   python -m venv "$venv_dir"
# '''

# Scripts defined in the `[profile]` section are *sourced* by *your shell* and
# inherit environment variables set in the `[vars]` section and by `[hook]` scripts.
# The `profile.common` script is sourced by all shells and special care should be
# taken to ensure compatibility with all shells, after which exactly one of
# `profile.{bash,fish,tcsh,zsh}` is sourced by the corresponding shell.
[profile]
# common = '''
#   echo "it's gettin' flox in here"
# '''

# The `[services]` section of the manifest allows you to define services.
# Services defined here use the packages provided by the `[install]` section
# and any variables you've defined in the `[vars]` section or `hook.on-activate` script.
[services]
# postgres.command = "postgres --config-file=pg.conf"

# Additional options can be set in the `[options]` section. Refer to
# manifest.toml(5) for a list of available options.
